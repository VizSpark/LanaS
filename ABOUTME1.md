I’m Lana Sisson, a Data Visualisation Manager at Vodafone, where I lead efforts to transform complex data into clear, actionable insights. My passion for data visualization has always been cantered on simplifying intricate information to empower our Company to make informed decisions and drive progress. As I continue to grow in my career, I’m constantly refining my ability to create user-friendly visual solutions that make data more accessible and impactful.

Currently, I’m focused on harnessing the power of data visualization to drive innovation and change within Vodafone’s D&A Visualisation & Business Partnering department. I am deeply committed to continuous improvement, simplification, and creating solutions that are both effective and efficient. As I pursue my BSc (Hons) in Data Science at BPP University, I’m gaining cutting-edge knowledge and skills to stay ahead of the curve, ensuring that I can implement the latest methodologies in data science and visualisation.

A key part of my role is fostering a team environment where every individual has a voice and is empowered to contribute their unique creativity. I believe that by unleashing the full potential of our team members, we can deliver exceptional data visualization solutions that not only address today’s needs but also anticipate and shape the future. We value continuous learning and collaboration, encouraging everyone to explore new technologies and approaches that will drive our shared success.

Looking ahead, I’m excited to continue pushing the boundaries of data visualization, delivering solutions that not only meet but exceed the expectations of our customers and stakeholders.

Outside of work, I’m a dog mum to my Chihuahua, Poppy, a keen cook, and a lover of nature and creative outlets like publishing colouring books on Amazon. I always strive to stay balanced, inspired, and creative in everything I do.
