# **The Evolution of Netflix - Clustering** 


<h2 style="color: red;">Overview</h2>
The growth of Netflix, Amazon Prime and other streaming services is of great interest as a movie fan and the evolution of how we now ingest our media. This project aims to identify the trends from Netflix Data sourced from Kaggle, to observe how content released by year has changed in volume and evolved over time, including differences in genre popularity and regional trends, for example original content vs certain genre types, further analyzing any additional insights that are identifiable using clustering algorithms

The output of the clustering models was validated against Silhouette Score, Calinski-Harabasz Index and Davies-Bouldin Index. The results show the change in density of increase in Content length by release year, which highlights changes movie into the pandemic with TV Shows season length increase over recent years, with clear gap analysis showing strategic opportunities by Country and Genre

The learning from this project offered great insight into new work-based projects, especially looking at the growth and change of key brands within the market and how their sales have changed over time, from regional level date to specifics on customer type and brand purchased. This will impact on the company by allowing patterns and trends to be identified to support marketing and the acquisition logistics for our Trading and Logistics teams.


<h2 style="color: red;">Data Infrastructure and Tooling</h2>

The tool used will be Python, other considerations were Excel, Power BI, MicroStrategy. Although Power BI and MicroStrategy offer fantastic Visuals and interactivity, what they lack is the ability to Fine Tune parameters that are more achievable through Python and clustering Algorithms, Power BI allows for customization, but it is not intuitive to use and cumbersome to integrate without extensive knowledge, Parameter tuning is more straightforward within Python for example with libraries like scikit-learn with extensive options. To allow this flexibility and variety the decision was to use python.

K-Means Clustering will be used in this project versus Hierarchical. K-Means is efficient and scalable algorithm for large datasets, The clusters formed as part of K-Means are simple and easily interpreted, by each cluster being formed around a centroid, finally K-Means offers flexibility allowing the number of clusters to be changed to explore more granular detail.

Other considerations were hierarchical clustering and DBSCAN, Hierarchical was not chosen as it can be computationally heavy, especially with using large datasets, within intention of future scalability, finally based on it creating a dendrogram (tree like diagram) – it is not easy to adjust the number of clusters and often too complex to interpret. DBSCAN requires very careful tuning of parameters which can make the results significantly varied also time consuming to align, finally not performing well if the clusters are not arbitrarily shaped and like hierarchical being heavy computationally, Due to K-Means Efficient, scalable, flexible and easily interpretable this is the algorithm that will form key foundation of the project.



When looking at Netflix's evolving strategy it sits on multiple key pillars.

1. A reduction to fewer, yet higher quality productions maximize subscriber engagement. (AInvest. 2025)  
2. Netflix seeks to generate earned media value through conversation-starting, "buzzworthy" content like Jake Paul vs Mike Tyson, NFL, WWE. (Oakes, O. 2025)
3. Netflix is pursuing a selective approach to live programming, only investing where it offers unique value for diversification and subscriber growth. (AInvest. 2025) and (Oakes, O. 2025).
4. Further integration AI to enhance personalization, building better recommendation, supporting customer satisfaction, and stronger retention rates. (Works, A. 2024) and (Livemint. 2025).

The requirement for strategic content, Increased media coverage, targeted content, powered by AI personalising the platform  – will be vital for navigating the ever-changing streaming platform landscape.


<h2 style="color: red;">Data Preparation (Pre-Processing) </h2> 

<h3><u>Step 1. Import Necessary Libraries</u></h3>

<h3><u>Step 2. Load and Inspect data</u></h3>

![Alt text describing image output_143_0]({{ '/assets/img/Load and Inspect.png' | relative_url }})

![Alt text describing image output_143_0]({{ '/assets/img/head.png' | relative_url }})

![Alt text describing image output_143_0]({{ '/assets/img/shape and info.png' | relative_url }})

<h3><u>Step 3. Manage and Remove Missing values</u></h3>

It was identified 7 columns had missing values each column was reviewed independently to access impact on wider data frame

- **date_added** equated to 0.1135% of total data set – missing values (appendix 1.1)
- **rating** equated to 0.04542% of total data set – missing values (appendix 1.2)
- **duration** in this instance had been added into the incorrect rating column, causing a misalignment into listed_in column equated to 0.03406% total dataset (appendix 1.3)

![Alt text describing image output_143_0]({{ '/assets/img/null.png' | relative_url }})

These rows were dropped from the dataset due to low impact

![Alt text describing image output_143_0]({{ '/assets/img/null drop.png' | relative_url }})

<h3><u>Step 4. Standardize Columns and Categories</u></h3>

![Alt text describing image output_143_0]({{ '/assets/img/Category.png' | relative_url }})

<h3><u>Step 5. Convert data types</u></h3>

![Alt text describing image output_143_0]({{ '/assets/img/Date.png' | relative_url }})

<h3><u>Step 6. Handle Outliers</u></h3>
Review of outlier completed on Release year and Date Added, upon further investigation no action was required to remove outiers for impacting dataset, however an additional column was created Decade to support further bucketing

![Alt text describing image output_143_0]({{ '/assets/img/Outlier Release year.png' | relative_url }})

![Alt text describing image output_143_0]({{ '/assets/img/Outlier Date added.png' | relative_url }})

<h3><u>Step 7. Duplicate Removal</u></h3>

<h2 style="color: red;">Clustering Approach 1 </h2>
<h3><u>Data Processing and Modelling with K-Means (Movies and TV Shows)</u></h3>

Initial Approach was to cluster Movies / TV Shows to understand patterns and groups over release years and duration of content. The data was split into two data frames movies_data and tv_shows_data with durations being extracted from object columns into numerical float columns for TV Shows.

Due to sensitivity of K Means the features are scaled to enable them to be standardized and converted to a scaled dataframe with both columns being numerical. 

<h3><u>Parameter Determination</u></h3>
When review the optimal number of clusters this was validated against a Silhouette Score although the optimum score is two visually with the elbow curve the selection for the cluster was five at the next highest score for both TV Shows and Movies

<h3><u>Clustering Results</u></h3>
The initial output from the clustering showed the density change from 1990 for movies being released, with an emerging shorter duration film from 2008 Cluster 1, although TV Dataset is smaller duration in seasons have increased from 2000 spiking in 2020.

<h2 style="color: red;">Clustering Approach 2 - Genre and Country </h2>

Secondary approach to understand insight between Genre and Country, this data required cleaning, initial assumption taken, due to some data having multiple countries and multiple Genres

To extract only the first Country and First Genre under the assumption this is the Primary datapoint, then conversion from Categorical to numerical datapoints Using a MultiLabelBinarizer to create separate Binary data frames for Country and Genre allocation

<h3><u>Feature Selection</u></h3>

![Alt text describing image output_143_0]({{ '/assets/img/feature.png' | relative_url }})
    
<h3><u>Parameter Determination</u></h3>
When reviewing Parameter Determination for K it was evident that silhouette score needed additional validation and extension from 10 clusters to 15 to decide K from elbow, this was further validated against Calinski-Harabasz Index and Davies-Bouldin Index to determine Optimal K, which gave mixed output on strength of clusters, decision was taken to use 7 based on elbow and Silhouette

<h3><u>Clustering Results</u></h3>

The clustering results looked at top 5 countries by cluster, this did not give a clear output to highlight potential opportunities by genre for specific countries, PCA and visualisation on scatter plot also used

![Alt text describing image output_143_0]({{ '/assets/img/pca approach 3.png' | relative_url }})

<h2 style="color: red;">Approach 3</h2>
<h3><u>Movie Genre Gap Analysis by Country</u></h3>

To review Top 10 Country Genres listed against global average to identify opportunities by country to increase genre penetration onto platform. Early investigation showed potential insights for example United Kingdom highlights gaps within comedies and Family movies but strength in Documentaries as well as other areas for growth

![Alt text describing image output_143_0]({{ '/assets/img/Blue and red 1.png' | relative_url }})
![Alt text describing image output_143_0]({{ '/assets/img/Blue and red 2.png' | relative_url }})
![Alt text describing image output_143_0]({{ '/assets/img/Blue and red 3.png' | relative_url }})

Final step moved to review by Genre Top Countries by proportion against global average, with Colour differentiation to indicate opportunities

![Alt text describing image output_143_0]({{ '/assets/img/green and orange 1.png' | relative_url }})
![Alt text describing image output_143_0]({{ '/assets/img/green and orange 2.png' | relative_url }})


<h2 style="color: red;">Conclusion</h2>
The analysis successfully identified trends, movie release density and duration over decades. The genre gap analysis approach supported potential insights, highlighting specific areas, like the UK market, where genre offerings diverge significantly from global averages, large opportunities in specific genres Horror and Stand-up comedy this suggests further strategic opportunities.
Although methodology used provided a flexible framework for exploration, the analysis had limitations due to assumptions made during data pre-processing, particularly regarding primary country and genre allocation. Not allowing for multi genre films or the introduction of sub genres and multiple listing across global countries.
In summary, the project successfully identified key content trends and potential market gaps, as a starting block to investigate paving more robust strategic analysis through the proposed next steps 

<h3 style="color: red;">Next Steps</h3>
Based on the results of the three approaches taken, the next steps would be.

- Remove the assumption from Country column, to review impact on Genre performance 
- Use of secondary data set from IMBD or rotten tomatoes to understand popularity of Score of Movie / TV Show and its impact on results against Country (Lakshmi, N. 2016) and (Leone, S. 2020).
- Finally, look at country subscriber numbers , against all above criteria to delve into more strategic results to drive revenue growth with further exploration of gap analysis. (sureshmuthusamy001p. 2023), (adnananam. 2023) and (mauryansshivam. 2023).
